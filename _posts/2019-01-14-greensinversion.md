Greensinversion is an implementation of model-based inversion data analysis for pulse (flash) thermography image sequences. The main page for Greensinversion, including slides and published papers is at <https://thermal.cnde.iastate.edu/greensinversion.xml>. It can be downloaded from <https://github.com/isuthermography/greensinversion>. You will also need the Greensconvolution package, which can be downloaded from <https://github.com/isuthermography/greensconvolution>.

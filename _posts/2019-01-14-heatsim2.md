Heatsim2 is a package for performing finite difference calculations of heat conduction. It is designed to support layered media with in-plane anisotropy such as composite laminates. Calculation set-up is from Python but the internal solver is written in C for high performance. It uses an alternating direction implicit (ADI) Crank- Nicholson solver.

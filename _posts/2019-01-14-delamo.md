De-la-mo (De-Lamination-Modeler) is a system for constructing layer-by-layer finite element models or sub-models of composite materials. It is designed to be able to model curved surfaces as well as the presence of delamination, fiber breakage, and/or matrix cracking. You build the De-La-Mo model by specifying a set of manufacturing instructions â€“ creation of a mold, creation of a layer over that mold, creation of additional layer(s), bonding of layers, meshing, etc. De-la-mo then outputs a CAD model and script for creating the finite element model.

* Dave Forsyth has proposed creating a nonprofit for maintaining open source NDE software. Dave had a conflict for the meeting time; hopefully we can get a deeper discussion next time
* Mike Jackson: Project to define a new set of file formats. 
 * Paul Wilcox mentioned a project to define a second version of a file format for full-matrix capture ultrasound data. It is to be published within a few weeks. The underlying file format HDF5. The file format is just defining a set of fields. Can add unlimited fields & structures. It includes metadata the bare minimum to interpret raw data + recommended optional tags, e.g. amplifier gain.
 * Steve Holland: The benefit of a bit of structure in file format is that it allows a generic viewer

 * Next meeting tentatively Thursday April 18th 11ET/10CT/8PT (Potential of readjusting to align with ASNT research conference if a lot of participants would be there)

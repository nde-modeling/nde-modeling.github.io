Shareable nondestructive evaluation (NDE) models and modeling infrastructure will facilitate a new generation of NDE research and application.  The goals are to maximize the impact of modeling efforts and to facilitate the re-use of models developed by others. This will enable much broader use of models than
previously possible. Examples include the use of models in probability of
detection (model assisted POD), model-based inversion, and model-assisted design. It will reduce the amount of unnecessary "reinventing the wheel".
